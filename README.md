[A-POP](https://a-pop.vercel.app/), is a HD Music Stream Application ðŸŽ§ built in order to provide high sound clarity to 
respective Youtube or SoundCloud Songs, and that too without ads and video streaming! Just Music and Chill ðŸ˜‰
It's actually a hack for students, to listen to songs and bgm's from Youtube without even buffering data for video streams.

It is built using GraphQL, Apollo Client, Material-UI and obviously React! 

API is being hosted on Heroku using Apollo Client!
